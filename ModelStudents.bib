abstract = {Multi-patch models - also known as metapopulation models - provide a simple framework within which the role of spatial processes in disease transmission can be examined. An n-patch model which distinguishes between k different classes of individuals is considered. The linear stability of spatially homogeneous solutions of such models is studied using an extension of an analysis technique previously described for a population setting in which individuals migrate between patches according to a simple linear term. The technique considerably simplifies the analysis as it decouples the nk dimensional linearized system into n distinct k-dimensional systems. An important feature of the spatial epidemiological model is that the spatial coupling may involve non-linear terms. As an example of the use of this technique, the dynamical behavior in the vicinity of the endemic equilibrium of a symmetric SIR model is decomposed into spatial modes. For parameter values appropriate for childhood diseases, expressions for the eigenvalues corresponding to in-phase and out-of-phase modes are obtained, and it is shown that the dominant mode of the system is an in-phase mode. Furthermore, the out-of-phase modes are shown to decay much more rapidly than the in-phase mode for a broad range of coupling strengths. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Seasonal change in the incidence of infectious diseases is a common phenomenon in both temperate and tropical climates. However, the mechanisms responsible for seasonal disease incidence, and the epidemiological consequences of seasonality, are poorly understood with rare exception. Standard epidemiological theory and concepts such as the basic reproductive number R 0 no longer apply, and the implications for interventions that themselves may be periodic, such as pulse vaccination, have not been formally examined. This paper examines the causes and consequences of seasonality, and in so doing derives several new results concerning vaccination strategy and the interpretation of disease outbreak data. It begins with a brief review of published scientific studies in support of different causes of seasonality in infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R 0 , disease outbreaks, endemic dynamics and persistence. Finally, a mathematical analysis of routine and pulse vaccination programmes for seasonal infections is presented. The synthesis of seasonal infectious disease epidemiology attempted by this paper highlights the need for further empirical and theoretical work.},

abstract = {Seasonality is a driving force that has a major effect on the spatio-temporal dynamics of natural systems and their populations 1–5 . This is especially true for the transmission of common infectious diseases (such as influenza, measles, chickenpox and pertussis), and is of great relevance for host–parasite relationships in general 1–23 . Here we gain further insights into the nonlinear dynamics of re-current diseases through the analysis of the classical seasonally forced SIR (susceptible, infectious or recovered) epidemic model 6,7 . Our analysis differs from other modelling studies in that the focus is more on post-epidemic dynamics than the outbreak itself. Despite the mathematical intractability of the forced SIR model, we identify a new threshold effect and give clear analytical conditions for pre-dicting the occurrence of either a future epidemic outbreak, or a 'skip'—a year in which an epidemic fails to initiate. The threshold is determined by the population's susceptibility measured after the last outbreak and the rate at which new susceptible individuals are recruited into the population. Moreover, the time of occurrence (that is, the phase) of an outbreak proves to be a useful parameter that carries important epidemiological information. In forced sys-tems, seasonal changes can prevent late-peaking diseases (that is, those having high phase) from spreading widely, thereby increasing population susceptibility, and controlling the triggering and inten-sity of future epidemics. These principles yield forecasting tools that should have relevance for the study of newly emerging and re-emerging diseases controlled by seasonal vectors. The strong effect of seasonality on population dynamics is no better seen than in the historical long-term data sets of seasonally recurring childhood infectious diseases, such as measles, mumps and chickenpox. These diseases are driven by the seasonally changing contact rate between children which increases sharply at the begin-ning of each school year, and strongly controls the ensuing disease transmission. Figure 1a, c displays two time series of reported cases of measles in New York (1928–64) and London (1948–68) in the pre-vaccination era 4–6 . Major epidemics peak close to Spring each year, and on many occasions every second year if the dynamics are biennial and the outbreak 'skips' a year. Note there is also a strong erratic and possibly chaotic component, as seen in the variability of peak heights of the epidemics, as well as the intermittent jumps between periods of annual and biennial dynamics 4–12 . Theoretical studies have shown that seasonal forcing can be responsible for inducing similar complex population dynamics such as higher-order cycles, resonances and deterministic chaos 6,7,10–26 . These complex responses can easily mask any simple underlying mechanistic processes that might otherwise help in forecasting future epidemics (Fig. 1 legend). The modelling framework used here helps uncover, and gives new insights into, these processes. The driving force maintaining recurrent epidemic dynamics has long been recognized to be the continuous birth and recruitment of new susceptible individuals into the population 1,5,6,25 . As an outbreak progresses, susceptibles (S) become infected, drop to a minimum level (S 0) in the wake of the epidemic, and then grow in number as the birth process begins to dominate once again. The pattern of epidemics from year to year is controlled by the population's periodically changing annual contact rate. Our mathematical analysis has shown it useful to focus on S 0 , defined as the local minimum number of susceptibles left in the wake of an epidemic. S 0 controls whether there will be an outbreak in the year ahead or the number of ensuing skips that follow. To a good approximation, we have shown that to generate k or more consecutive skips in successive years requires that S 0 fall below: S c (k){\~{}} czm b 0 {\{} (kz1)mx 2 ð1Þ}},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is believed to play an important role in the persistence and dynamics of epidemics of childhood diseases because asynchrony between populations within different regions allows global persistence, even if the disease dies out locally. A simple multi-patch (metapopulation) model for spatial heterogeneity in epidemics is analysed and we examine conditions under which patches become synchronized. We show that the patches in non-seasonal deterministic models often oscillate in phase for all but the weakest between patch coupling. Synchronization is also seen for stochastic models, although slightly stronger coupling is needed to overcome the random effects. We demonstrate that the inclusion of seasonal forcing in deterministic models can lead to the maintenance of phase differences between patches. Complex dynamic behaviour is observed in the seasonally forced spatial model, along with the coexistence of many different behaviours. Compared to the non-spatial model, chaotic solutions are observed for weaker seasonal forcing; these solutions have a more realistic minimum number of infectives.},

Using the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model, we are able to provide new insights into the dynamics of recurrent diseases and, in some cases, specific predictions about individual outbreaks. The analysis reveals a new threshold effect that gives clear conditions for the triggering of future disease outbreaks or their absence. The threshold depends critically on the susceptibility S (0) of the population after an outbreak. We show that in the presence of seasonality, forecasts based on the susceptibility S (0) are more reliable than those based on the classical reproductive number R (0) from the conventional theory.},

abstract = {Multi-patch systems, in which several species interact in patches connected by dispersal, offer a general framework for the description and analysis of spatial ecological systems. This paper describes how to analyse the local stability of spatially homogeneous solutions in such systems. The spatial arrangement of the patches and their coupling is described by a matrix. For a local stability analysis of spatially homogeneous solutions it turns out to be sufficient to know the eigenvalues of this matrix. This is shown for both continuous and discrete time systems. A bookkeeping scheme is presented that facilitates stability analyses by reducing the analysis of a k-species, n-patch system to that of n uncou-pled k-dimensional single-patch systems. This is demonstrated in a worked example for a chain of patches. In two applications the method is then used to analyse the stability of the equilibrium of a predator–prey system with a pool of dispersers and of the periodic solutions of the spatial Lotka–Volterra model.},

However, few systems are well enough documented both to detect repeated waves and to explain their interaction with spatio-temporal variations in population structure and demography. Here, we demonstrate recurrent epidemic travelling waves in an exhaustive spatio-temporal data set for measles in England and Wales. We use wavelet phase analysis, which allows for dynamical non-stationarity--a complication in interpreting spatio-temporal patterns in these and many other ecological time series. In the pre-vaccination era, conspicuous hierarchical waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to small towns; the introduction of measles vaccination restricted but did not eliminate this hierarchical contagion. A mechanistic stochastic model suggests a dynamical explanation for the waves-spread via infective 'sparks' from large 'core' cities to smaller 'satellite' towns. Thus, the spatial hierarchy of host population structure is a prerequisite for these infection waves.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have considered a dynamical model of infectious disease that spread by asymptomatic carriers and symptomatically infectious individuals with varying total population size, saturation incidence rate and discrete time delay to become infectious. It is assumed that there is a time lag ($\tau$) to account for the fact that an individual infected with bacteria or virus is not infectious until after some time after exposure. The probability that an individual remains in the latency period (exposed class) at least t time units before becoming infectious is given by a step function with value 1 for 0≤t≤$\tau$ and value zero for t{\textgreater}$\tau$. The probability that an individual in the latency period has survived is given by e- $\mu$$\tau$, where $\mu$ denotes the natural mortality rate in all epidemiological classes. Pulse vaccination is an effective and important strategy for the elimination of infectious diseases and so we have analyzed this model with pulse vaccination. We have defined two positive numbers R1 and R2. It is proved that there exists an infection-free periodic solution which is globally attractive if R1{\textless}1 and the disease is permanent if R2{\textgreater}1. The important mathematical findings for the dynamical behaviour of the infectious disease model are also numerically verified using MATLAB.

The population system is subjected to dispersal of individuals among the subpopulations as well as to local and global disturbances. We observe a tight positive correlation between global extinction rate and the level of synchrony in dynamics among thesubpopulations. Global disturbances and to a lesser extent, migration, are capable of synchronizing the temporal dynamics of the subpopulations over a rather wide span of the population growth rate r. Local noise decreases synchrony, as does increasing distance among the subpopulations. Synchrony also levels off with increasing r: in the chaotic region, subpopulations almost invariably behave asynchronously. We conclude that it is asynchrony that reduces the probability of global extinctions, not chaos as such: chaos is a special case only. The relationship between global extinction rate, synchronous dynamics and population growth rate is robust to changes in dispersal rates and ranges.},
